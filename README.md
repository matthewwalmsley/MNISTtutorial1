# MNITStutorial
Getting to grips with Tensorflow (and Python!)

MNIST is a simple computer vision dataset consisting of images of handwritten digits.

This tutorial runs through using tensorflow to learn about some basic methods (apparently the ML version of Hello World!).

My first foray into Tensorflow, following the tutorials for:
- Installation (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac)
- MNITS itself (https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners)
